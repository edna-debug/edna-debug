  Sometimes I wonder how someone I’ve already shared my deepest moments with can still make me feel so alive, <br><br>so hopeful, and so loved. But then I remember that love isn’t just about the moments we’ve shared—<br>it’s about the connection that grows deeper with every touch, every glance, and every whispered word. <br><br>And you, Craig, have connected with me in ways I never thought possible.<br><br>As John Green said, *‘I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once.’* That’s exactly how it happened with you. <br>Slowly, through every word, every shared moment, and every intimate embrace, and then all at once, <br>I realized I couldn’t imagine my life without you. You’re not just someone I love—you’re someone I’ve become one with, in every way.  <br>

  Through our dating life, i rank you on top of every aspect.<br><br> Hulooop for the love. I wish i met you earlier kababaa😊
